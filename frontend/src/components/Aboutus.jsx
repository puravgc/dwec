          DWEC&#39;s vision for a more inclusive and equitable Nepali society is
          deeply intertwined with its purpose, mission, and overarching goal.
          Through its clear mission to empower women and girls with disabilities
          and encourage their active participation in all spheres of society,
          DWEC aims to contribute to the realization of this vision. By adopting
          a Rights-Based Approach (RBA) in its program design and
          implementation, DWEC ensures that its activities promote participation
          and inclusion, ultimately working towards the creation of a society
          where everyone enjoys equal rights and social benefits. This approach
          not only aligns with DWEC&#39;s mission but also supports the
          achievement of its overall goal of protecting the rights of women and
          girls with disabilities and increasing their inclusion in mainstream
          society. Furthermore, DWEC recognizes that its mission and overall
          goal serve as guiding principles for both strategic planning and
          day-to-day operations, ensuring that all program activities are
          directly linked to advancing its mission and vision for a more
          empowered and inclusive society.
